# rest-assured-api
# In this project we will implement the RestAssured libraries and other helper libraries for the API calls
     # -- GET, POST
     # -- Libraries used : RestAssured, Matchers, Jackson for POJO implementations, Jayway/JQL and TestNG for unit testcases
     # -- We will learn different ways to make a POST call
          # -- directly passing the json string 
          # -- supplying the .json file path
          # -- supplying the POJO class object
    # -- We will also implement @DataProvider to supply inputs
